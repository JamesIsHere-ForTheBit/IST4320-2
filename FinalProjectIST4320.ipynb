    "My goal for this project is for the user to choose from a drop down menu what category of snacks they are in the mood for, and for the program to choose a random one in that catefgory for them. It can be annoying to choose your own snack sometimes, so this would take away the pain of choosing!\n",
    "\n",
    "The app worked (finally, it took a lot of hours haha), but in hindsight I would to have liked users to have the option to insert their own snacks from the UI window instead of having to go change the code, maybe in a future update! I learned a lot about SQL commands (well, more of a refresher), and I also learned about sqlite3, which I had not used before (at least not in this capactity)."
